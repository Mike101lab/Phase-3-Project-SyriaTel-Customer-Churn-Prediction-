# SyriaTel Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. Customer churn is a critical business problem as losing customers directly impacts revenue. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, SyriaTel can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering personalized plans, discounts, or improved customer service.

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on their usage patterns, demographics, and billing information.

## Business and Data Understanding
### Stakeholder
The primary stakeholder is **SyriaTel**, a telecommunications company interested in reducing customer churn.

### Business Problem
Customer churn is a significant issue in the telecom industry. SyriaTel wants to identify customers who are likely to stop using their services so they can take targeted retention actions. This project will help SyriaTel:
- Predict which customers are at risk of churning.
- Understand the key factors driving churn.
- Develop actionable strategies to retain customers.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **SyriaTel Customer Churn Dataset** from Kaggle. It contains approximately 3,333 rows and 21 columns, including:
- **Target Variable**: `churn` (binary: Yes/No).
- **Features**: Customer demographics (e.g., state, area code), call details (e.g., total day minutes, total evening calls), and billing information (e.g., total charges, account length).

### Key Questions
1. What factors contribute most to customer churn?
2. Can we predict churn with high accuracy?
3. What actionable insights can SyriaTel derive from the model?

## Modeling
We will follow an iterative approach to modeling:
1. Start with a baseline model (e.g., logistic regression).
2. Experiment with more complex models (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
3. Tune hyperparameters to improve performance.
4. Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Evaluation
The final model will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict churn. Key metrics will include:
- **Precision**: To minimize false positives (customers incorrectly identified as churn risks).
- **Recall**: To minimize false negatives (customers at risk of churn who are not identified).
- **ROC-AUC**: To assess the model's overall performance.

## Conclusion
The findings and recommendations will be summarized here after the analysis is complete.
